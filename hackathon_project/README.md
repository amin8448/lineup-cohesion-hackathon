## 🏆 Key Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Model R²** | **0.873** (87.3% variance explained) |
| **Cross-validation R²** | **0.539** (100 random 70/30 splits) |
| **Connectivity coefficient** | β = 11.87 (p < 0.001) |
| **Hub Dependence coefficient** | β = 10.00 (p < 0.001) |

### The Hub Dependence Paradox

> **Conventional wisdom:** Balanced passing networks (equal distribution) should outperform centralized ones.
>
> **Our finding:** Elite teams benefit from strategic centralization through hub players. Network inequality *positively* predicts success.

## 📊 Final Model

```
Expected Points = 46.5 + 11.87×Z_Connectivity + 10.00×Z_Hub_Dependence
```

| Component | Coefficient | p-value | Description |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Connectivity** | +11.87 | < 0.001 | Network density + clustering coefficient |
| **Hub Dependence** | +10.00 | < 0.001 | Gini coefficient of degree distribution |

*Coefficients are unstandardized: a 1-SD increase in each metric corresponds to ~10-12 additional league points.*

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data
- **Source:** IMPECT Open Data via kloppy
- **Scope:** Bundesliga 2023/24 season (306 matches, 18 teams, 612 team-match observations)
- **Network construction:** Directed, weighted passing networks per team per match

### Metrics
- **Density:** Proportion of possible edges that exist
- **Clustering Coefficient:** Tendency of players to form connected triads
- **Degree Centralization (Hub Dependence):** Gini coefficient of pass involvement

### Validation
- Stepwise OLS regression eliminated Chemistry (p=0.919) and Progression (p=0.516)
- Final 2-component model validated with 100× cross-validation
- Moderate test R² (0.539) confirms generalization despite small sample (N=18)

## 📈 Case Studies

### Bayer Leverkusen (1st Place — Undefeated)

**Record:** 28W-6D-0L | 90 points | +63 GD

**Network Architecture:** Dual-Hub System
- **Volume Hub (Granit Xhaka):** 95 passes/90min, 92% completion — possession recycler
- **Attack Hub (Florian Wirtz):** Highest betweenness centrality — creative catalyst

**Resilience:** When top player (Palacios) removed, cohesion drops only **1.1%**

### SV Darmstadt 98 (18th Place — Relegated)

**Record:** 4W-7D-23L | 17 points | -50 GD

**Network Architecture:** Fragmented — no consistent hub structure

**Fragility:** When top player (Nürnberger) removed, cohesion drops **7.8%**

### The Insight

Elite teams don't just have better players — they have systems that distribute cohesion across depth. Bayern Munich (champions) has the **lowest** max player impact (0.29%), while struggling teams show dangerous star-dependence.

## ⚠️ Limitations

- **Sample size:** N=18 teams limits statistical power
- **Single season:** Generalizability requires replication across leagues/years
- **Confounders:** Wage expenditure, transfer value not controlled
- **Causality:** Correlational analysis only
- **Data quality:** ~24% of passes lack receiver ID
